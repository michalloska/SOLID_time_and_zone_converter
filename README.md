# solid-time-and-zone-converter
Implement a simple converter allowing time convertion from GMT (Greenwich Mean) to  PDT (Pacific Daylight Time (North America)) and vice-versa. Converter should be implemented  in a way that allows extending it easily when adding new time zones.

## REMARK
Writing this project in c++ turned out to be much more complicated than anticipated at first.Therefore the project is not perfect and I am fully conscious about it. Implementation of Time etc was very time consuming

## How to Run:

Compile:
>make

Compile and/or Run: </br>
Due to the fact a project like this requires using Makefile the program has to be run a bitt differently to what was written in documize:

>make run TIME=(time_to_be_converted) SRCT=(source_time_zone) DESTT=(destination_time_zone) 

eg.:
```
make run TIME=11:00 SRCT=PDT DESTT=GMT
OUTPUT:
./Executable 11:00 PDT GMT
Converting 11:00 PDT(UTC-8:00) to GMT(UTC+0:00)
Outcome Time:19:00

OR:

make run TIME=11 SRCT=PDT DESTT=GMT
OUTPUT:
./Executable 11:00 PDT GMT
Converting 11:00 PDT(UTC-8:00) to GMT(UTC+0:00)
Outcome Time:19:00
```

Supported TimeZones:
* PDT UTC-8:0 
* GMT UTC+0:0
* IRST UTC+3:30 (IRANIAN TIME ZONE)


Implemented Time Zones are present in the TimeZoneConverterUtils.hpp file. More can be there.
If timezone is not supported a suitable output will be displayed

Clean:
>make clean

Run UT tests:
>make test

Remark: in order to run UT tests Google Test has to be installed.

**Instruction on how to run them will be added soon**
